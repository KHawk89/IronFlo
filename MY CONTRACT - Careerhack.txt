MY CONTRACT


As I go through the CareerHack Program, I hope to learn more about 
Data Analysis und prepare myself best as possible for a job. I also hope to connect to many nice people which endures long time.


Some challenges I may face are running low on self-esteem or motivation, not having enough time to dedicate to the course.


To deal with these challenges I plan to share my feelings openly with my girlfriend, and make the course my number one priority over the rest of my commitments.
Furthermore i try to remember myself to my aims.



During the program, I commit to putting time aside for myself, because I want to achieve my goal of becoming a professionell Data Analyst.
